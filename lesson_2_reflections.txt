What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	Invisible files get created by git. The repository then awaits files to be added to it.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a temporary space that holds the files that have changes in them, ready to be committed.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	Run git status to make sure only one commit is in the staging area.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

	If I wanted to keep a working copy of a program, but have another version to experiment with. 
	If I want to try out a new feature or fix a bug without affecting the master.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

	I can see visually the linear pattern of branches and how they merge or split.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

	The result is a new master (a new tip). It will contain parts of two different branches, combined into one version.


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
